# VagusNerveStimulation

In this project, we stimulate the vegus nerve to initialize cardiac asystole. During cardiac asystole the heart stops beating for a specific amount of time. The goal of the 
project is to initialite cardiac asystole for open heart surgery. Traditionally cardioplegia solution is used to stop the heart while open heart surgery is performed but it 
has been said to cause post surgical complecation. 

In this project we build a model of the vagus nerve that can be stimulated to induce cardiac asystole. On stimulating the vagus nerve, the heart stops beating for a specific 
amount of time specified by the user. 

For more details of the project, please check out the presentation slide and the project document. 

This project was done as a group for the Neural Implants class at Johns Hopkins University for my masters degree.
